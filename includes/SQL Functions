<a href='posts.php?source=edit_post&p_id={$post_id}'><i class='fa fa-pencil' aria-hidden='true'></i></a>
Here when the user clicks, the href directs to edit_post.php page within the posts.php page and passes p_id as an argument. This direction to another page is done using [source = ""] and p_id caught using a $_GET variable.

$post_content = substr($row['post_content], 0,100);
substr() has 3 parameters. If we want to display a string only between 0 - 100th characters, then this function is very userful. This can be used to display a part of blog post in the main home page.
